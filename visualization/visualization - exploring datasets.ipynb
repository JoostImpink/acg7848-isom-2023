    "Seaborn uses matplotlib to draw its plots. For interactive work, it’s recommended to use a Jupyter/IPython interface in matplotlib mode, or else you’ll have to call matplotlib.pyplot.show() when you want to see the plot. It automates the creation of multiple figures but sometimes leads to OOM (out of memory) issues.\n",
